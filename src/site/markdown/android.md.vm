How to use flattr4j on Android devices
======================================

For running _flattr4j_ v2 on Android, at least Android 3.0 "Honeycomb" is needed. Lower API levels do not work because the Flattr server makes use of SNI. I recommend to use at least _flattr4j_ v2.13, especially if you run into HTTPS certificate issues.

Requirements
------------

In order to use flattr4j on Android, you need to copy the `flattr4j-core.jar` to your project's `libs` directory.

flattr4j also needs the _json.org_ library. However, it is already provided by Android and does not need to be installed separately. So, you only need to copy the `flattr4j-core.jar` to your project.

Since flattr4j connects to the Flattr API via HTTP, your application needs `INTERNET` permission to run.

Usage
-----

The flattr4j core API can be used without restrictions on Android, including `FlattrService` and `FlattrAuthenticator`.

Gradle
------

Make sure that `json` is excluded when you use build tools with dependency management.

If you are using Gradle for Android development (e.g. Android Studio), add this dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile('${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}-core:${project.version}') {
        exclude module: 'json'
    }
}
```

Maven
-----

If you are using Maven for Android development, add these dependency lines:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}-core</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <scope>compile</scope>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.json</groupId>
      <artifactId>json</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>
```
