# Open Data API

Some calls of the Flattr API do not need authentication. They are collected in a separate service called `org.shredzone.flattr4j.OpenService`.

Instances of the `OpenService` are generated by the `FlattrFactory`.

```java
FlattrFactory factory = FlattrFactory.getInstance();
OpenService service = factory.createOpenService();
```

That's it, the service is now ready to use. This is an example of how to get a list of all available categories:

```java
List<Category> catList = service.getCategoryList();

for (Category category : catList) {
  System.out.printf("%-20s%s\n", category.getId(), category.getName());
}
```
