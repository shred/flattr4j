# Java Flattr Client ![build status](https://shredzone.org/badge/flattr4j.svg) ![maven central](https://shredzone.org/maven-central/org.shredzone.flattr4j/flattr4j/badge.svg)

_flattr4j_ is a free open source Java library for using the [Flattr](https://flattr.com) API. It can be used on Android apps, but also on Java based servers, web sites and desktop applications.

_flattr4j_ is not an official client. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with Flattr AB or Eyeo GmbH.

## DISCONTINUED

Due to the lack of documentation, and no prospect of getting further help from Flattr, I decided to discontinue this project. Version 2.14 is the final release.

## Important Note

Flattr has changed its API. Because of that, some of the _flattr4j_ calls are failing or not delivering the expected results any more.

## Features

* Lightweight and easy to use
* Covers the entire Flattr API
* Also runs on Android
* JSP tag library for inserting static and javascript Flattr buttons
* Helps through the OAuth authentication process at Flattr, no OAuth knowledge is needed
* With Maven and Gradle support
* Stable and mature code base, started in 2010

## Usage

* See the [online documentation](https://shredzone.org/maven/flattr4j/) about how to use _flattr4j_.
* _flattr4j_ is available at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.shredzone.flattr4j%22).
