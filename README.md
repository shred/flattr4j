# Java Flattr Client ![build status](https://shredzone.org/badge/flattr4j.svg) ![maven central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.shredzone.flattr4j/flattr4j/badge.svg)

_flattr4j_ is a free open source Java library for using the [Flattr](https://flattr.com) API. It can be used on Android apps, but also on Java based servers, web sites and desktop applications.

_flattr4j_ is not an official client. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with Flattr AB or Eyeo GmbH.

## Important Note

Flattr is currently changing its API. Because of that, some of the _flattr4j_ calls are failing or not delivering the expected results any more. Sadly there is no up-to-date documentation of the current API, or about their general plans for a future API.

Are you getting a "_Received fatal alert: handshake failure_" exception? Try the latest OpenJDK version, or use Oracle Java.
